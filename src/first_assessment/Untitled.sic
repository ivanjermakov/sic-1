; Now that you understand the "subleq" instruction, the ".data"
; directive, and labels, you should be able to read values from input
; and write the exact same values out, by negating the value twice.
;
; Below is an almost complete solution. You will need to replace
; instances of "???". Hint: use a label that points to a storage
; location for a (negated) value.

@loop:
subleq @tmp, @IN
subleq @OUT, @tmp
subleq @tmp, @tmp, @loop  ; Reset @tmp to zero, and jump to @loop

@tmp: .data 0
